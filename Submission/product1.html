                        The String of Fishhooks is an easy-to-care-for and robust succulent. It sits beautifully on a
                        shelf
                        because of its trailing vines. The String of Fish Hooks is very similar to the String of Bananas
                        and
                        can sometimes be mixed up. The String of Fish Hooks is blueish green in color and the leaves are
                        much thinner and hook-like. This plant comes in its 6" hanging plastic nursery pot.
