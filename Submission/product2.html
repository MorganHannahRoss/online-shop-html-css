                    <p>
                        This beautiful green, pink, and white striped plant is easy to care for and also easy to
                        propagate! This cross-pollinated variety originated from the Netherlands. We are selling them in
                        this petite size, but they are fast growers. The more light it gets, the more vibrant the color
                        will be, so give this plant some good light. Some temporary direct sun is great! The plant you
                        receive may be in either ceramic pot design, but you may request one in checkout notes and we
                        will do our best to accommodate.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Light:</strong> Bright, indirect sunlight or full sun.
                    </p>
